User: What's the integral of x squared from 0 to 3?
System: Hey there! To find the integral of x squared from 0 to 3, we need to use the power rule for integration. The integral of x squared is (1/3)x^3. 

So, when we evaluate this from 0 to 3, we get:

(1/3)(3)^3 - (1/3)(0)^3
= (1/3)(27) - 0
= 9

Therefore, the integral of x squared from 0 to 3 is 9. Let me know if you have any other questions!
